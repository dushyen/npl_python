    "The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.<br>\n",

    "Number of users: 256,059<br>\n",

    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",

    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "Great flavor, low in calories, high in nutrients, high in protein! Usually protein powders are high priced and high in calories, this one is a great bargain and tastes great, I highly recommend for the lady gym rats, probably not \"macho\" enough for guys since it is soy based...\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "For those of you wanting a high-quality, yet affordable green tea, you should definitely give this one a try. Let me first start by saying that everyone is looking for something different for their ideal tea, and I will attempt to briefly highlight what makes this tea attractive to a wide range of tea drinkers (whether you are a beginner or long-time tea enthusiast).  I have gone through over 12 boxes of this tea myself, and highly recommend it for the following reasons:<br /><br />-Quality:  First, this tea offers a smooth quality without any harsh or bitter after tones, which often turns people off from many green teas.  I've found my ideal brewing time to be between 3-5 minutes, giving you a light but flavorful cup of tea.  However, if you get distracted or forget about your tea and leave it brewing for 20+ minutes like I sometimes do, the quality of this tea is such that you still get a smooth but deeper flavor without the bad after taste.  The leaves themselves are whole leaves (not powdered stems, branches, etc commonly found in other brands), and the high-quality nylon bags also include chunks of tropical fruit and other discernible ingredients.  This isn't your standard cheap paper bag with a mix of unknown ingredients that have been ground down to a fine powder, leaving you to wonder what it is you are actually drinking.<br /><br />-Taste:  This tea offers notes of real pineapple and other hints of tropical fruits, yet isn't sweet or artificially flavored.  You have the foundation of a high-quality young hyson green tea for those true \"tea flavor\" lovers, yet the subtle hints of fruit make this a truly unique tea that I believe most will enjoy.  If you want it sweet, you can add sugar, splenda, etc but this really is not necessary as this tea offers an inherent warmth of flavor through it's ingredients.<br /><br />-Price:  This tea offers an excellent product at an exceptional price (especially when purchased at the prices Amazon offers).  Compared to other brands which I believe to be of similar quality (Mighty Leaf, Rishi, Two Leaves, etc.), Revolution offers a superior product at an outstanding price.  I have been purchasing this through Amazon for less per box than I would be paying at my local grocery store for Lipton, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tea that is comparable, and even better than, other teas that are priced much higher.  It offers a well-balanced cup of green tea that I believe many will enjoy.  In terms of taste, quality, and price, I would argue you won't find a better combination that that offered by Revolution's Tropical Green Tea.\n",
